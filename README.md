# Wikipedia Name Game
## This is a project that aims to play the internet game of seeing how many clicks it takes on a Wikipedia page to get to a certain person or article

### Steps I want to take:
1. First scrape all the links of a wikipedia
page, and write them to a file. Done throught a
Scraper.py (plan)

2. Read the link in a file, and for each link 
run the scraper.py to find the links in that article

3. Check if the desired article is "hit" (steps 2 and 3 are the main)
